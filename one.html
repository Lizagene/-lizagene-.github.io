i like new things. i like tables where the chairs dont quite match, i like being pressed closer to a stranger than i ever have to my friends, i like the indent that concrete leaves in my skin after i get up from the curb ive been sitting on. i like medrona trees. i like that they grow in every direction but down. 

i still get scared when the ground shakes and i can feel the earth moving. i can feel the texture of seaweed touching my skin. it is still 2017. i have not yet left my home for the day.
